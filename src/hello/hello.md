 NinNin is a Book Lab for ZK. 

Written by [supamongkon.r@gmail.com](https://github.com/supamongkonR)
This book aims to introduce everyone interested in ZK technology and in need of an easy-to-follow guide to mastering it, beginning with the fundamentals.

## Why do we need to learn this?

- If you are interested in blockchain or are a developer, zero-knowledge (ZK) technology will become an increasingly important field since the day this book was published.

## Security Risk

- While any system working with credentials or privacy involves some risk of unauthorized access, this book focuses on teaching you how to understand and write circuits, a fundamental skill for working with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). ZKPs offer a way to prove information is true without revealing the information itself, which can be crucial for building secure and private systems. To learn more about the specific implementation details of circuits,   I recommend referring to the official Circom documentation: [`RTFM`](https://docs.circom.io/)

Furthermore, this book does not provide development advice.

Okay, let's learn!
