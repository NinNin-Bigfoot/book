# What is ZK

At first you will understand that ZK technology is not blockchain, and you may wonder how blockchain use this technology

***ZK***
- Cryptographic technique for proving knowledge (Privacy)
aim for ```Privacy-preserving verification```

***Blockchain***
- Distributed ledger for transactions (Transparent)
aim for ```Cryptocurrencies, Supply chain```


This two thing is seerately difference approch, but ZK can use for bring privacy approch to public blockchain network like we saw in ternado cash. 💸🌪️

> How it differ between ZK in public blockchain and Private Blockchain it's use same technology or not ?

Answer : No it not the same one

pls go to this [Repository](https://github.com/supamongkonR/Multiple-Tenancy-Hyperledger-Besu) that I've to create 2 years ago to see how to make private blockchain using hyperledger besu and tessera.

and if you want some, or need to run private blockchain in you local pls visit this [Repository](https://github.com/supamongkonR/blockchain-network)

this is how besu and tessera work to send private transaction.

you will see in private network we need to setup another node call tessera to manage about privacy and also working along with libraly call [Web3js-quorum](https://github.com/ConsenSys/web3js-quorum)

OK I'll don't go too much with private blockchain but the this is why in context of Privacy between Privacy with ZK and Privacy with private blockchain is difference.
